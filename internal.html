    <h1>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</h1>

    <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I suggest you
        try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>

    <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. <strong> I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.</strong> <em> Leave that to
        me.</em> Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>

    <h2>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck.</h2>

    <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possiblyâ€¦ Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Leave
        that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
        <li>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</li>
        <li>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</li>
    </ol>
